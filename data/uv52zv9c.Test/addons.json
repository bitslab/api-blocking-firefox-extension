When you browse the web, your data leaves a digital footprint. This footprint, connected by tracking technologies (called trackers), helps companies build a profile about you and how you interact with their sites and their competitors, allowing them to optimize their communications and site experience to reach you - and others like you - at the right place, at the right time.\n\nGhostery gives you the control to make informed decisions about the personal data you share with the trackers on the sites you visit.\n\nEnjoy a faster web\nSome sites take too long to load. This can be due to trackers weighing your system down. Ghostery allows you to block the offending trackers and significantly speed up your browsing.\n\nGet the content you want\nRemove page clutter so you can focus on the content you want.\n\nControl your data\nSometimes being connected can help you find the data you need quicker, like a location tracker that helps you find the closest cafe. Sometimes it spoils the fun, like a remarketing tracker, revealing the birthday present you wanted kept a surprise.
