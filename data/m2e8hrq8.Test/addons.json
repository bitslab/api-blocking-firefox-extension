When you browse the web, your data leaves a digital footprint. This footprint, connected by tracking technologies (called trackers), helps companies build a profile about you and how you interact with their sites and their competitors, allowing them to optimize their communications and site experience to reach you - and others like you - at the right place, at the right time.\n\nGhostery gives you the control to make informed decisions about the personal data you share with the trackers on the sites you visit.\n\nEnjoy a faster web\nSome sites take too long to load. This can be due to trackers weighing your system down. Ghostery allows you to block the offending trackers and significantly speed up your browsing.\n\nGet the content you want\nRemove page clutter so you can focus on the content you want.\n\nControl your data\nSometimes being connected can help you find the data you need quicker, like a location tracker that helps you find the closest cafe. Sometimes it spoils the fun, like a remarketing tracker, revealing the birthday present you wanted kept a surprise. Ghostery makes locking down your data easier.\n\nBe Informed, Take Control\nGhostery gives you the tools needed to understand the different types of trackers and how they may impact your overall browsing experience, putting the power directly in your hands.\n\nConnect and Learn More\nHow does Ghostery make money: https://www.ghostery.com/en/faq/how-does-ghostery-make-money-from-the-add-on/\nBlog: https://www.ghostery.com/en/intelligence/category/consumer-blog/\nFAQ: https://www.ghostery.com/en/faq/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostery\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ghostery\nSupport: https://www.ghostery.com/support","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134424.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","width":"700","height":"508","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134424.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"Menu shows you all the web bug trackers found on a site and lets you learn more about each bug including being able to view their source code."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134426.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","width":"700","height":"424","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134426.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"121","caption":"New Ghostery panel allows for quick tracker settings, selective site unblocking, and many other new features."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134428.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","width":"700","height":"396","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134428.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"113","caption":"Get notified when web bugs are found.
